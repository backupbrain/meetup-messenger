Hi {organizerFirstName},

I'm a developer who's been working on an open-source login system called OPAQUE-KE. It uses encryption to eliminate the need to send passwords from client to server, or for the server to store user passwords. This technology is being implemented by Facebook and Cloudflare among others.

Password leaks are obviously a major problem in the software industry, so I think your attendees would love to learn how to eliminate this threat entirely from their work.

I have a presentation that I would love to share, which shows at a high level how the new system works, plus a GitHub link to see a code implementation.

Would you be interested in me presenting this topic at an upcoming {groupName} event?

Cheers
Tony
